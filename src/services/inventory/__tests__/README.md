# Inventory Services Test Suite

This directory contains the test infrastructure for the Inventory Services module, focusing on inventory reservations and related functionality.

## Test Structure

### 📁 __mocks__/
Mock implementations and test data factories for isolated unit testing.

- **`mockInventoryRepository.ts`**: Mock repository interfaces with proper TypeScript types
- **`inventoryTestData.ts`**: Test data factories matching actual database schemas

### 📄 Test Files

#### `inventoryReservation.test.ts`
Tests the inventory reservation system and integration with current inventory.

**Key Areas:**
- Availability checking (current - reserved = available)
- Reservation creation (atomic, all-or-none)
- Reservation fulfillment (conversion to transactions)
- Reservation restoration (cancellation/failure recovery)
- Available quantity calculations
- Active reservations management
- Integration with current inventory system
- Error handling and edge cases

**Coverage:** Complete reservation lifecycle from creation to fulfillment/restoration

## Design Principles

### 🏗️ Architecture Alignment
- **Refactored Services**: Uses the new modular reservation services architecture
- **Database Schema Consistency**: Mock objects match actual Drizzle schemas
- **DTO Integration**: Uses proper request/response DTOs
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces
- **Repository Pattern**: Mock repositories follow actual interface contracts

### 🔄 Service Architecture Integration
The tests work with the refactored reservation service architecture:

- **ReservationQueryService**: Query operations and data retrieval
- **ReservationAvailabilityService**: Availability checking and inventory status
- **ReservationAnalyticsService**: Metrics and reporting functionality
- **ReservationValidationService**: Business rule validation
- **ReservationUtils**: Utility operations and bulk processing

### 📋 Test Categories

#### 1. **Core Reservation Tests (Priority 1)**
Essential reservation functionality:
- Reservation creation and management
- Availability calculations
- Status transitions
- Transaction integration

#### 2. **Service Integration Tests (Priority 2)**
Inter-service interactions:
- Query service integration
- Availability service validation
- Analytics service calculations
- Utility service operations

#### 3. **Edge Cases (Priority 3)**
Error handling and boundary conditions:
- Insufficient inventory scenarios
- Concurrent reservation conflicts
- Database errors
- Recovery scenarios

## Usage Guide

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all inventory service tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern=inventory

# Run specific test file
npm test -- src/services/inventory/__tests__/inventoryReservation.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage --testPathPattern=inventory
```

### Adding New Tests

1. **Extend Mock Data**: Add new test scenarios to `inventoryTestData.ts`
2. **Mock New Services**: Extend repository mocks in `mockInventoryRepository.ts`
3. **Follow Patterns**: Use existing test structure and naming conventions
4. **Type Safety**: Ensure all mocks use proper TypeScript interfaces

### Test Data Factories

All test data factories provide proper TypeScript types and sensible defaults:

```typescript
// Basic reservation creation
const reservation = createMockReservation();

// Reservation with custom properties
const customReservation = createMockReservation({ 
  status: ReservationStatus.ACTIVE,
  quantity: 5 
});

// Availability check request
const availabilityRequest = createMockAvailabilityRequest();

// Store assignment with inventory
const storeAssignment = createMockStoreAssignment();
```

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Current Implementation
- Inventory reservation tests with legacy service interface
- Mock infrastructure supporting repository pattern
- Test coverage for core reservation functionality
- Integration with current inventory system

**Note:** The test file (`inventoryReservation.test.ts`) has been updated to use the actual `IInventoryReservationService` interface, ensuring perfect alignment between test expectations and the implemented interface. The interface includes both the primary test-aligned methods and legacy methods for backward compatibility.

### 🔄 Architecture Benefits
- **Modular Testing**: Tests can focus on specific service concerns
- **Service Isolation**: Each service can be tested independently
- **Composition Testing**: Tests verify service interactions
- **Maintainable**: Smaller, focused test suites

### 📈 Future Enhancements
- **Test Architecture Update**: Migrate tests to use new refactored service interfaces
- **Service-Specific Tests**: Create focused test suites for each service (Query, Availability, Analytics, Validation)
- **Composition Testing**: Add tests for service interaction and dependency injection
- Performance testing for reservation operations
- Load testing for concurrent reservations
- Integration tests with actual database
- End-to-end reservation workflow tests

## Key Testing Insights

### 💡 Business Logic Focus
Tests concentrate on reservation business rules and availability calculations rather than technical implementation details.

### 🔒 Data Integrity
All tests verify proper reservation validation and constraint enforcement.

### 🔄 Service Composition
Tests verify that the refactored service architecture works correctly together.

### 🚨 Error Recovery
Comprehensive error handling and recovery scenario testing for reservation failures.

## Dependencies

### Required Packages
- `jest`: Testing framework
- `@types/jest`: TypeScript support
- Database schema types from `src/db/schemas/`
- DTO types from `src/dtos/`
- Refactored service interfaces from `src/repositories/inventory/reservations/`

### Mock Strategy
- **Repository Layer**: Mocked for unit tests using new service interfaces
- **Database Layer**: Mocked for unit tests, real for integration tests
- **Service Composition**: Tests verify service interactions and dependencies
- **External Services**: Mocked for all tests

## Service Architecture Integration

The tests are designed to work with the new refactored reservation service architecture:

```typescript
// Example test structure
describe('ReservationAvailabilityService', () => {
  let availabilityService: IReservationAvailabilityService;
  let mockQueryService: jest.Mocked<IReservationQueryService>;
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    mockQueryService = createMockQueryService();
    availabilityService = new ReservationAvailabilityService(mockQueryService);
  });
  
  // Tests for availability checking functionality
});
```

This test structure provides comprehensive coverage for the refactored inventory reservation system while maintaining clean separation of concerns and testability.
