## Technical Specifications

### Database Schema Changes
```sql
-- Applied via npm run db:push
ALTER TABLE tank_type ADD COLUMN is_active boolean DEFAULT true NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE tank_type ADD COLUMN deleted_at timestamp;

ALTER TABLE inventory_item ADD COLUMN is_active boolean DEFAULT true NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE inventory_item ADD COLUMN deleted_at timestamp;
```

### Key Business Rules Implemented
1. **Price Validation**: Sell price must be greater than purchase price
2. **Unique Names**: No duplicate names within each product type
3. **Reference Safety**: Cannot delete products referenced in orders or inventory
4. **Soft Delete**: Products are marked inactive rather than physically deleted
5. **Restoration Safety**: Cannot restore if active product with same name exists

### Error Handling Strategy
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid input data, validation errors
- **404 Not Found**: Product not found
- **409 Conflict**: Duplicate names, deletion blocked by references
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Database or system errors

All errors include structured responses with error codes and descriptive messages.

### Performance Optimizations
- Parallel database queries for list operations (data + count)
- Indexed lookups on active status and names
- Efficient pagination with offset/limit
- Optimized search queries with ILIKE for partial matching

## Testing Strategy

**Note**: Tests were not implemented per client request to focus on other modules.

**Planned Test Coverage** (for future implementation):
- Repository layer: CRUD operations, filtering, reference checking
- Service layer: Business logic validation, error scenarios
- API layer: Request validation, response formatting, authentication

## Integration Points

### Store Catalog Integration
- New products automatically populate to all active stores
- Base pricing used as default for store catalog pricing
- Store catalogs maintain independent pricing after initialization

### Orders System Integration
- Products cannot be deleted if referenced in any orders
- Order items maintain references to specific product versions
- Soft delete preserves order history integrity

### Inventory System Integration
- Products cannot be deleted if referenced in current inventory
- Inventory assignments track specific product types
- Transaction history maintains product traceability

## Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization
- All endpoints require authentication via bearer token
- Permission-based access control using existing permission system
- Role-based operations (admin and operator users can manage products)

### Input Validation
- Comprehensive request validation using Zod schemas
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Price manipulation validation and business rule enforcement

### Data Protection
- Soft delete maintains audit trails
- No sensitive data exposure in error messages
- Proper error handling prevents information leakage

3. **Repository Pattern**: Interface-based design for testability and maintainability
4. **Error Handling**: Custom error classes for proper HTTP status mapping

### Development Efficiency
- Single session completion due to clear planning and documentation
