# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the LPG Backend application. The pipeline ensures code quality, automated testing, and streamlined deployment processes.

## Pipeline Architecture

### Current Implementation

The CI/CD pipeline consists of two main workflows:

1. **CI Pipeline** (`ci.yml`) - Runs on every push and pull request
2. **Release Pipeline** (`release.yml`) - Runs on pushes to main branch

### Pipeline Stages

#### 1. Continuous Integration (CI)

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop` branches

**Jobs:**
1. **TypeScript Type Check**
   - Validates TypeScript types across the codebase
   - Uses `npm run typecheck` command
   - Blocks pipeline progression on type errors

2. **Build Application**
   - Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript
   - Uses `npm run build` command
   - Uploads build artifacts for 30 days
   - Depends on successful type check

3. **Run Tests (Optional)**
   - Executes Jest test suite
   - Uses `npm test` command
   - Configured as non-blocking (`continue-on-error: true`)
   - Uploads coverage reports if available

#### 2. Release Pipeline

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` branch only
- Ignores documentation and non-code changes

**Jobs:**
1. **Quality Gate**
   - Runs type check, build, and tests
   - Tests are non-blocking but logged
   - Must pass for release to proceed

2. **Create Release**
   - Generates semantic version tags
   - Creates GitHub releases with changelogs
   - Uploads build artifacts to releases

## Configuration Details

### Environment Variables

- `NODE_VERSION`: '20' (Node.js version for all jobs)

### Artifact Management

- **Build Artifacts**: Stored for 30 days, available for download
- **Coverage Reports**: Uploaded regardless of test outcome
- **Release Assets**: Attached to GitHub releases permanently

### Versioning Strategy

**Tag Format:** `v{package.version}-{timestamp}`

Example: `v1.0.0-20241216-143022`

**Components:**
- `package.json` version as base
- Timestamp for uniqueness
- Automatic changelog generation from commit history

## Security Considerations

- Uses GitHub's built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` for authentication
- No external secrets required for current implementation
- Artifacts have limited retention periods

## Future Production Deployment

### Planned Architecture

```
Development → CI Pipeline → Release → Production Deploy Pipeline → Cloud Infrastructure
```

### Production Pipeline Requirements

When implementing production deployment:

1. **Cloud Provider Integration**
   - AWS/GCP/Azure authentication
   - Container registry access
   - Infrastructure provisioning tools

2. **Environment Management**
   - Staging environment deployment
   - Production environment deployment
   - Environment-specific configurations

3. **Deployment Strategies**
   - Blue-green deployments
   - Rolling updates
   - Rollback capabilities

4. **Monitoring Integration**
   - Health checks post-deployment
   - Performance monitoring
   - Error tracking integration

### Recommended Tools for Production

- **Containerization**: Docker (already configured)
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes or Docker Swarm
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform or CloudFormation
- **Secret Management**: AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or HashiCorp Vault
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana or cloud-native solutions

## Commands Reference

### Local Development Commands

```bash
# Type checking
npm run typecheck

# Build application
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test
npm run test:coverage

# Development server
npm run dev
```

### CI/CD Related Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies (CI optimized)
npm ci

# Production build
npm run build

# Test with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Type Check Failures**
   - Fix TypeScript errors locally before pushing
   - Run `npm run typecheck` to verify

2. **Build Failures**
   - Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
   - Check for syntax errors in TypeScript files

3. **Test Failures**
   - Tests are currently optional but recommended to fix
   - Run `npm test` locally to debug issues

4. **Release Creation Issues**
   - Verify GitHub token permissions
   - Check branch protection rules

### Pipeline Status

- **Green**: All stages passed successfully
- **Yellow**: Tests failed but build succeeded (acceptable)
- **Red**: Type check or build failed (blocks release)

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

1. **Update Dependencies**
   - Monitor for security vulnerabilities
   - Update Node.js version in workflows when needed

2. **Review Pipeline Performance**
   - Monitor build times
   - Optimize job parallelization as needed

3. **Clean Up Artifacts**
   - Artifacts auto-expire after 30 days
   - Manual cleanup of old releases if needed

### Workflow Updates

When modifying workflows:
1. Test changes in feature branches first
2. Update this documentation accordingly
3. Notify team of any breaking changes

## Getting Started

### For New Team Members

1. Ensure your local environment can run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run typecheck
   npm run build
   npm test
   ```

2. Understand the branching strategy:
   - `develop` - active development
   - `main` - production-ready code

3. Follow the pull request process:
   - CI pipeline must pass before merge
   - Code review required

### For Deployment Setup

When ready to implement production deployment:

1. Choose cloud provider and set up accounts
2. Configure infrastructure as code
3. Extend release pipeline with deployment jobs
4. Set up monitoring and alerting
5. Update this documentation with new procedures

This pipeline provides a solid foundation for scaling to full production deployment while maintaining code quality and reliability.
